# **`octapush.docs`**
Quoted from [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/):

> Good documentation is key to the success of any project. Making documentation accessible enables people to learn about a project; making it easy to update ensures that documentation stays relevant.
>
> Two common ways to document a project are _README_ files and _wikis_:
> - README files are quick and simple way for other users to learn more about your work
> - Wikis on github help you present in-depth information about your project in useful way.
